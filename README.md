## Description:
This is a football team themed card matching game project I built and created from scratch using HTML and CSS for the layout and JavaScript for the functionality of the cards and the timer in the game, gives the game the ability to know which cards match and which cards do not, and gives the player a certain amount of time to match all of the cards before it runs out.
